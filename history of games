<head> North American Video Game Crash (1983) <head/>
       There was an E.T. video game created. The makers of the game only had about 6 weeks to create the game, so the
       game was not good at all.  Nobody liked the game, and the consumers especially didn't like it. Millions of the copy 
       of the game were dumped in the desert. Another  thing that contributed to the video game crash was there were so many 
       consoles at the time that people were confused about the different 
       consoles.
